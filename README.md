# Messaging Server

### Classes and their Responsibilities:

1. **Message**:
    - Contains fields for content, header (with recipient or type information), and a timeout.
    - Contains methods to get and set these fields.
  
2. **QueueMessage extends Message**:
    - Contains a field for recipient.
  
3. **TopicMessage extends Message**:
    - Contains a field for type.
  
4. **MessageQueue**:
    - Uses a `LinkedList<QueueMessage>` (FIFO structure) to store messages.
    - Methods to add, remove, and get messages based on recipient.
    - Limit to the number of messages it can hold.

5. **Topic**:
    - Uses a `List<TopicMessage>` to store messages.
    - Methods to add and get messages based on type.
    - No explicit limit, but messages have a timeout.

6. **MessageServer**:
    - Contains instances of MessageQueue and Topic.
    - Responsible for routing messages to the correct queue or topic.
    - Handles administration tasks, like setting expiration times.
  
7. **Client**:
    - Represents an application communicating with the server.
    - Can send and receive messages.
    - For topic messages, a client subscribes to a certain type.

### Threads and Concurrency:

- **Producer Thread**: These threads are created when a client wants to send a message. They will add messages to the relevant queue or topic.

- **Consumer Thread**: These threads are created when a client wants to receive a message. They will remove messages from the queue or read from topics.

- **Cleanup Thread**: This is a background thread that periodically checks for expired messages in the topics and removes them.

Concurrency Problems:

1. **Race Conditions**: Multiple clients might try to send or read messages concurrently. Without proper synchronization, this can lead to issues like reading the same message multiple times or missing messages.

2. **Deadlocks**: Improper ordering of locks can lead to a situation where one thread holds one lock and waits for another, which is held by another thread.

### Proposed Java Architecture:

1. **Use `ReentrantLock` and `Condition`**:
    - Use a `ReentrantLock` to synchronize access to the MessageQueue and Topic.
    - Use `Condition` for handling cases where a consumer might need to wait for a message to be available.
  
2. **Java ExecutorService**: To manage threads efficiently, use Java's `ExecutorService`. It offers a higher-level replacement for the traditional way of managing threads and provides a clean and efficient way to handle concurrency.

3. **ScheduledExecutorService**: Use this for the Cleanup Thread to periodically check and remove expired messages.

4. **Java NIO for Networking**: If you're considering making this server network-enabled, Java NIO (or Netty, a popular NIO-based framework) can be used for scalable and efficient networking.

5. **Observer Pattern for Topics**: Since topics are essentially a publish-subscribe model, use the Observer pattern. When a new message of a particular type is published, all subscribed clients are notified.

6. **Configuration**: To allow for administration and customization, have a configuration system. This could be a properties file or a more advanced configuration management system.

### Additional Suggestions:

1. **Persistence**: Consider adding a persistence layer (like a database) to store messages, especially if you need durability and reliability. 

2. **Logging**: Integrate a robust logging system like SLF4J with Logback to track server operations, errors, and client activities.

3. **Metrics & Monitoring**: Integrate metrics collection libraries like Micrometer or Dropwizard Metrics to monitor the server's health, performance, and other vital statistics.

This is a high-level overview and would need to be refined and detailed further based on exact requirements, scalability needs, fault tolerance, etc.
